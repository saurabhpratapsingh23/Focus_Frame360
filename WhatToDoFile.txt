create one attractive refresh button in header file, and when user click it refresh whole project APIs.

In emsPerformance file display Weekly Performance Summary table current month data on top followed by descending. example: august month data, then july, then june, etc.
also when if backend shows remarks/status = I then print "In-Progress", U then "yet-to-start", C then "Completed", S then "Reviewed"


similarly update for GoalTable file, display Table 1: Goals on top current month followed by descending order. 
also goal table 1 is having too many entries so in a first go show 15 rows and give one button below table to load more rows by clicking on it, will look better and simple.
